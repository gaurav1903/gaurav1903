<h2>About me</h2>

Hi, Iâ€™m Gaurav Arora â€” a Full Stack Developer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, Flutter, and scalable backend systems. I specialize in building high-performance, fault-tolerant, and revenue-impacting solutions that directly drive business growth.
At DigitalOcean, Iâ€™m contributing to making inter-service communication reliable, standardized, and fail-proof. In my previous role at Hindustan Times (HT Digital Streams), I engineered subscription and payment systems that:
-  Increased recurring orders by 30-35% within 3 months.
-  Reduced peak response times from 20s to 72ms by migrating to gRPC and optimizing queries.
-  Recovered 2+ Cr in lost revenue by identifying and fixing critical bugs affecting 10,000+ customers.
-  Built AI-powered chatbots using ChatGPT, cutting CX issues by 40%.
-  Launched innovative Gifting features that generated 70+ lakhs in revenue within weeks.

I have also delivered cross-platform mobile solutions in Flutter, optimized video streaming to cut buffer times by 40%, and developed large-scale apps with strong UI/UX focus and backend reliability.

Iâ€™m a 3-time Insta Award Winner at HT Digital Streams, ranked Top 5% globally in Facebook HackerCup, Google CodeJam, and other global coding competitions.

<b>What I bring to the table:</b>
-  Proven ability to identify bottlenecks and turn them into revenue opportunities.
-  Strong background in AI integration, real-time systems, and scalable architecture.
-  End-to-end product development skills â€” from backend APIs to intuitive mobile experiences.

âš¡ Fun fact: I get really excited when learning new algorithms and data structures. <b>I have been doing competitive programming for 4 years now. I have previously ranked in top 5% globally in both Google Codejam and Facebook Hackercup and even qualified to round 2 in the latter.</b>  
ðŸ’¬ I'm a very social person,so go ahead ask me anything.
