<h2>About me</h2>

I am Gaurav Arora, currently pursuing BTech in Computer Sciences from Jamia Millia Islamia [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-arora-05a855198/). I am very keen to learn new technologies and methodologies and use them to either create something useful or improve the existing softwares.  
âš¡ Fun fact: I get really excited when learning new algorithms and data structures. <b>I have been doing competitive programming for 2 years now. This year i ranked in top 5% globally in both Google Codejam and Facebook Hackercup and even qualified to round 2 in the latter.</b>  
ðŸ’¬ I'm a very social person,so go ahead ask me anything.
